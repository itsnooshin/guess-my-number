# what i learned
As a result of this project, I learned how to change the background color in javascript and how to compare scores using if/else statements

```js
 document.querySelector('body').style.background = 'green';

```
```js
 if (!guess){
   document.querySelector('.title__right-box').textContent =  'â›” No answer' ; 
    
   }
   else if(guess === secretNumber){
    document.querySelector('.title__right-box').textContent =  'ðŸŽ‰ correct number' ; 
   }

```
